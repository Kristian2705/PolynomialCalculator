A simple project that simulates the calculations of polynomials with rational coefficients.
Here is a list of all the functionalities:
1) Addition of two polynomials
2) Subtraction of two polynomials
3) Multiplication of two polynomial
4) Division of two polynomials
5) Multiplication of polynomial by scalar
6) Finding the value of a polynomial at a given rational number
7) Finding the GCD of two polynomials
8) Displaying the Vieta's formulas for a given polynomial
9) Representation of a polynomial as powers of (x+a)
10) Factorization of polynomial and finding its rational roots
